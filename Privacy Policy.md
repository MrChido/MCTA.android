Privacy Policy and Intent for Spoonie
Last Updated: January 2026
Spoonie began as a love song to my wife — her idea, her intentions — and shaping it into a real tool has been a journey of discovery and wonder. What started as a personal project grew into something meant to help others: a compact, clear, user friendly way to notice the patterns and trends in their health over time. Spoonie is built to be simple, private, and supportive — nothing more complicated than that.
What Spoonie Stores
Spoonie saves only the information you choose to enter: your notes, symptoms, moods, or anything else you add. This data is stored in a sandboxed database on your device. It isn’t uploaded, transmitted, or shared with me or anyone else.
I’ve tested this myself on multiple devices — including my own and my wife’s — and the database isn’t accessible outside the app’s protected storage.
What Spoonie Does Not Collect
Spoonie does not collect or request:
•	your name
•	your address
•	your phone number
•	your location
•	your contacts
•	your email
•	or any other personally identifiable information
There’s no login, no account, no cloud service, and no analytics.
Data Storage, Updates, and Deletion
All data stays on your device. If you uninstall Spoonie, your data is removed with it.
Important note about updates:
In the current version of Spoonie, some updates may cause the app to lose its connection to the existing local database. When this happens, the app may need to reset its cache and create a new database. This can result in previously entered data being lost.
This behavior is not intentional, and I am actively working on improving how Spoonie handles updates so your data remains stable between versions.
If you rely on Spoonie for daily tracking, you may want to back up important information manually until this issue is resolved.
How Your Data Is Used
Your data is used only to make the app function — saving entries so you can view them later. Spoonie does not transmit, analyze, or share your data with any third party.
Not Medical Advice
Spoonie is a personal tracking tool. It does not make decisions about your health and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It’s meant to support conversations with your healthcare providers, not replace them.
Children’s Privacy
Spoonie is not intended for children under 13. Because the app does not collect personal information, it complies with child privacy requirements.
Changes to This Policy
If this policy changes, the “Last Updated” date at the top will be updated to reflect the revision.
