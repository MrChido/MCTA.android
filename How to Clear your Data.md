So, this document is to explain how Spoonie functions.

Spoonie installs a database deep inside your device.
Nobody can see it, nobody can touch it. I've dug into my own device,
I have dug into my wife's device. The database is there somewhere;
you can see it as you use Spoonie by adding information and viewing information.
Which is great because you are in control of your information. You choose who sees it
and how it is used. 
At this moment, there's no password protection within the app; your password will be how
You unlock your device. 

If you need to delete your information, you have two reliable methods. 
You can delete the app itself, or go into your device's settings and clear the data, which does not remove the app.

Removing the database DOES clear all entries, as the app will start fresh.

If you decide to remove the database, there is no recovery unless you recorded information elsewhere.
